Hey!

I'm Robert - I'm a Math and Economics graduate and am pursuing opportunities in data analysis. I have experience in Excel, R, Python, and SQL, and have previously worked in insurance, finance, and economic research. Whether it's automating data visualization through R, improving Excel macros for complex calculations, or communicating findings into actionable insights, I consistently apply my expertise to solving problems and creating impact.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2023 and took a 5-month break after school to travel around Europe, focusing on doing volunteer work for organizations such as Scandinavian Cello School. I'm particularly interested in problems within the fields of healthcare, sustainability, nonprofit work, or media/entertainment, and I'm always passionate about learning more about the world.

On the side, I also like to indulge in more offbeat data explorations, such as how your first name may be associated with certain personality traits (ongoing). I draw inspiration from creators like [Jon Bois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9H9LwGmc-0) and the ["Unusual"](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?acategory=unusual&page=1&type=awards) section of Information is Beautiful. Ultimately, I'd love to explore questions that interest me, ranging from topics like why "blue zones" claim to have healthier, happier people, or how music around the world varies in BPM, key usage, and chord structure, and what that might reveal about the underlying culture.

Outside of work, I like to travel, do crosswords, hike, and sing. I'm also learning how to crochet and bake (deliverables TBD...)!
